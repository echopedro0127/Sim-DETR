## Abstract

Temporal sentence grounding aims to identify exact moments in a video that correspond to a given textual query, typically addressed with detection transformer (DETR) solutions. However, we find that typical strategies designed to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2) internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

## Prerequisites

### 0. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/SooLab/Sim-DETR.git
cd Sim-DETR
```

### 1. Prepare datasets
#### QVHighlights

We use video features (CLIP and SlowFast) and text features (CLIP) as inputs. For CLIP, we utilize the features extracted by [R2-Tuning](https://github.com/yeliudev/R2-Tuning) (from the last four layers), but we retain only the `[CLS]` token per frame to ensure efficiency. You can download our prepared feature files from [qvhighlights\_features](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rRVID6OO5arVR1vL5SP5fcCFAJ35B-IK?usp=sharing) and unzip them to your data root directory.


### 2. Install dependencies

For Anaconda setup, refer to the official [Moment-DETR GitHub](https://github.com/jayleicn/moment_detr).

----------

## QVHighlights

### Training

Update `feat_root` in `sim_detr/scripts/train.sh` to the path where you saved the features, then run:

```bash
bash sim_detr/scripts/train.sh  
```


### Inference Evaluation and Codalab Submission

After training, you can generate `hl_val_submission.jsonl` and `hl_test_submission.jsonl` for validation and test sets by running:

```
bash sim_detr/scripts/inference.sh results/{direc}/model_best.ckpt 'val'
bash sim_detr/scripts/inference.sh results/{direc}/model_best.ckpt 'test'
```

Replace `{direc}` with the path to your saved checkpoint. For more details on submission, see [standalone_eval/README.md](standalone_eval/README.md).
